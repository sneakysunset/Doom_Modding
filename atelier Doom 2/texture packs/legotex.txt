	***************** GENERAL NOTES *******************


DIMENSIONS

If you are familiar with lego you'll know that what is considered the
'standard brick' is twice as long as it is wide, and has two rows of
4 'bumps' on its top. I shall refer to this brick as a 4x2 brick or
a '4 bump long' brick.

I've based the textures around this brick. In doom dimensions this
brick is 64 units long, 32 units wide and 32 units high. Okay, these
aren't the exact correct relative dimensions of a standard 4x2 brick,
but i've had to use a bit of artistic license.:)

Similarly, the lego plates (that are the same width and length, but
thinner) usually stack up 3 high to the standard 4x2 brick. This
would give them a Doom height of 10.66 units. Again, using the excuse
of artistic license, i've made them only 8 units high. This means
that they can be used as a standard Doom step, but as a result
they stack up 4 high to the standard 4x2 brick in Doom dimensions.

The switch patches are 65 units long and 32 units high. I made them 65
long, rather than 64, because the image i used looked slightly
unbalanced at 64 units.

You'll see that i've provided patches for bricks of 1,2,3,4,6 and 8 'bumps
in length'. Simply remember that each 'bump' is 16 units long - eg the 
standard 4x2 brick is '4 bumps long' and has a doom length of 64 units.


TEXTURES AND PATCHES

I'm presenting this as a kind of DIY texture set. There's a lot of
patches included, some of which have been used in the textures
provided in this wad. Some of the textures provided are of more
generic walls, some are examples of patch combinations possible.
However, the potential variations are huge. You may find that you
need to create a specific texture from the patches provided to fit
certain architectural features, or you may wish to try different
colour combinations. 


COLOURS

Due to the limitations of dooms palette, some colours look better than
others under differing lighting conditions. I've tended to use red
and blue bricks alot in my lego levels because they generally tend to
stay red and blue as the lighting drops. Other colours don't fare so
well, the purple texture quickly becomes grey in dark conditions (try
it and see for yourself). On the reverse side of things, red and blue
look absolutely gross when the lighting reaches maximum IMO, set the
brightness to 256 and put on your sunglasses :)


INCLUDING LEGO TEXTURES IN YOUR WAD

Feel free to use these textures in any way, shape or form in your levels.
If you want to extract just a couple of patches/textures and include them
in your wad thats fine. If you want to place the whole lot in your wad
that's okay too. I tend to be disuaded from downloading wads that state
'also requires x textures wad' or whatever. I'm just too lazy to go and
look for the required file. I prefer a single downloadable file with
everything embedded in the one wad, so i've no objection if you want to
do this with any of the textures/patches/flats i've provided. Just mention
in your text file that you got the graphics from here, thanks :)

	
CONTRIBUTIONS

If you create a lego themed image (patch, flat, etc) which you think may
be useful to other people, email it to me and i'll add it to this wad.
I've only really touched the surface of possible lego textures, there are
many things that can be added (eg lego style fences, window frames, doors,
etc). You might even come up with a better brick colour that suits the doom
palette.


HELP

If you are unsure of how to create textures using patches read the
documentation that comes with Wintex. It has a good tutorial covering
this subject and should provide the answers to any questions you may
have. 


	********************* FLATS ***********************


This is a complete set of flat replacements, all flats in Doom2
are replaced. I've tried to apply some logic to the order, so 
that in the Wadauthor flat viewer all the appropriate colours and
styles are grouped together.

The variations possible are huge, so you may want to create your
own flats if you don't see what you need here. There are a few flats
intentionally unused at the end of the wad, so that you can use 
these should you wish to include your own, but not overwrite any
existing ones.


	******************** TEXTURES *********************


LEGO_001 to 006	- Lego logo textures. Good for doors and other
		  such stuff.

LEGO_010 to 017 - Single colour textures using the standard 4x2
		  (4 bumps long, 2 wide) lego brick. Good textures
		  for general use. Each brick is 32 units high and
		  64 units long.

LEGO_050 to 051 - Similar to the above, but includes the odd 8x2
		  brick patch to make the texture appear less,
		  erm, 'uniform'. 

LEGO_100 to 123 - A group of textures showing the vast number of
		  differing textures that can be produced using
		  the patches provided. Here I used red and blue,
		  but obviously any of the colours can be used
		  (although some go better together than others).

LEGO_210 to 215 - Some examples of differing colour combinations.
		  Urg, that purple and blue texture is hideous.

LEGO_310 to 325 - Textures best suited to the sides and fronts of
		  steps. These are intended to give the impression
		  of thin lego 'plates' stacked on top of each 
		  other. Each plate is 8 units high and 32 or 64
		  units long (depending on which one you use).

LEGO_410 to 417 - Textures that represent the tops of lego bricks.
		  Obviously the 'flats' versions of these images
		  will get more use but i've included this graphic
		  as a wall texture in case someone feels the need
		  to use it.
		  	You could try to give the impression of
		  bricks on their sides but then you'd probably need
		  the 'underneath' graphic available as a texture
		  and the brick 'side' graphic available as a flat.
		  I haven't included these in this wad, but using a
	          good graphics program you should be able to construct
		  these from the patches and flats provided and then
		  insert them using wintex or similar.

LEGO_510 to 517 - Similar to 010-017 (single colour 4x2 bricks) but
		  with an apparent 32 unit offset. useful when the
		  alignment of both upper and lower textures conflict
		  to mess up the asthetics. I doubt this makes much
		  sense (but you'll understand instantly if you ever
		  have to use them).

LEGO_610 to 611 - Lego trees! Being a texture rather than a thing,
		  these will look flat if the player can get to close
		  and veiw them from a narrow angle. Best used as
		  scenery in the distance.

SW1xx to SW2xx  - Switches. I've replaced all of the switch graphics
		  with lego styled ones. You may want to play around
		  with the patches and come up with your own.
